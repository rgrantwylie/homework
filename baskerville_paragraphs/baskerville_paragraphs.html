        <h2><i>Letter Founder & Master Printer</i></h2>
        
        <p> John Baskerville (1706-1775) was an Englush businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included jappaning and papier-mâché; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>
        
        <p2> <span class="firstcharacter">B</span>askerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire, and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville printed works for the University of Cambridge and, although an athiest, printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Societa of Arts, who took the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted for most federal government publishing.</p2>
        <br> <br>
        <p2>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production. He developed a tehcnique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p2>
        
        <blockquote><p><i>“Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them. I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types according to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”</i></p>
